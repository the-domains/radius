# Recapture the Wonder

He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? (Romans 8:32 ESV)

A whole bloc of theological teaching through the centuries has basically promoted something quite contrary to the above revolutionary verse. This popular thinking basically leaves us with this powerful impression: "Because the Father sent Jesus to die on the cross to forgive us for our sins and take us to heaven if and/or when we die, we really don't need anything else...nor should we rightly expect anything else...from Him." Have you ever gotten this impression in the past as I have?

But what if it is very far from the truth? What if the Father says that He loves us so passionately, that He gave us the most valuable gift He had to give and that THIS IS THE VERY SIGNAL to us that He will not withhold anything else we need and even desire that helps us be more fruitful for Him in this world? What if we have lived far below the privileges we have been given in this age as co-heirs with Christ? What if we have believed a rather large lie due to the challenges...yes, even the necessary sacrifices and sufferings...associated with believing for and living in the good of this richer inheritance? What if Jesus actually meant what he said in these passages below and others like them? I think he did!

If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples...You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. (John 15:7, 8, 16 ESV)
