description: "In a vivid dream from the Lord this morning, I was a part of a team of scientists who had been doing extensive research through the years. We had made a breakthrough discovery that would change the world on a very basic level as it would inspire a massively helpful paradigm shift for people across the globe. We were getting prepared to inform the world through a press conference. Some of our team members were tempted to elaborate on the report, but we actually needed to keep it profoundly simple. It was compared in my dream to Einstein's breakthrough in physics - \"E equals mc squared\". Then I saw what we had discovered. It was a more fundamental understanding and intentional application of John 15:4-5 - Abiding in Jesus Christ ==> Fruitfulness. I knew that some people had experienced this reality in the past, but somehow, amid the cacophony of voices, the continual practice of \"abiding in Christ\" had been \"lost on\" most believers. But now, the Holy Spirit was highlighting and unveiling this absolute essential factor for true success in life. He was making it accessible to and practical for all the children of God. This dynamic focused on whatever good we might accomplish or whatever true successes we might enjoy...these things were, ultimately and literally, based on what Jesus had done for us and would do through us. God wants to download...not a new theory...but a new operating system into our beings. “Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.” John 15:4-5"
