In a dream early this morning I saw a new move of God's Spirit coming upon His people. It was about chosen vessels becoming more genuinely anointed to "share and sit down" rather than "stand up and shout". Spiritual leaders needed to understand the vast difference between God's dear children being motivated by compulsion (force/coercion from without) verses compunction (a light pricking of the conscience). (A voice in the dream kept repeating these two words in the background of my dream. I had never before considered them in comparison or contrast to each other.) These were the associated passages from Scripture in my dream. ""Behold, My Servant, whom I uphold; My chosen one in whom My soul delights. I have put My Spirit upon Him; He will bring forth justice to the nations. "He will not cry out or raise His voice, Nor make His voice heard in the street. "A bruised reed He will not break And a dimly burning wick He will not extinguish; He will faithfully bring forth justice." Isaiah 42:1-3 ""THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME, BECAUSE HE ANOINTED ME"... And He closed the book, gave it back to the attendant and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on Him." Luke 4:18, 20
