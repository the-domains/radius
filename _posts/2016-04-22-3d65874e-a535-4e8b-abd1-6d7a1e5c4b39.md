WELCOME TO RADIUS Radius is the Christ-centered ministry of Terri and Michael Sullivant. We are here to inspire your spiritual growth, spiritual formation and spiritual leadership. We pray, teach and preach, create connections, build up faith communities, advise, coach, listen and write. We seek to bring hope, faith and love to all of God's people everywhere we go! We'd love to connect with you as we are able and we believe that you will find some deep and ongoing hope and insight from the kinds of things that we regularly post on our site.
